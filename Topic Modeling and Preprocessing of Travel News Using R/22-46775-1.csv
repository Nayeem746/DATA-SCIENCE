When international travel resumed following the easing of Covid-19-related restrictions in 2022, Gregor Nassief, owner of Dominica's Fort Young Hotel and Dive Resort, was preparing for what many were calling the era of ""revenge travel"". With demand surging for all-inclusive holidays, he considered launching simple, one-stop-shop holiday packages. But he quickly realised that Dominica – nicknamed the ""Nature Island of the Caribbean"" – is not your typical beach destination. ""Travellers who come here don't want to do the fly-and-flop, where you sit at the beach and do nothing else,"" says Nassief. ""People come here to explore Dominica. It would be impossible for an all-inclusive offering to succeed here if we don't include the island."" Nassief's realisation is part of a broader shift in resort travel. Long associated with swim-up-bars, buffets and endless beach time, all-inclusive resorts are adapting to meet the changing expectations of post-pandemic travellers. Many now crave both ease and adventure, seeking a frictionless stay with access to meaningful local experiences. From guided hikes and cultural outings to restaurant dinners and self-drive excursions, the all-inclusive model is expanding to include more of the surrounding destination. The shift, which began in earnest around 2022, continues to evolve in 2025 as more travellers prioritise connection, authenticity and exploration – all from the comfort of a five-star resort. Nassief's ""island inclusive"" package launched in January 2022, offering guests not only full board and airport transfers, but a daily land or sea group excursion such as a trek to the spectacular waterfalls at Trafalgar Falls or a guided visit to lively Roseau Market. Despite requiring a five-night minimum booking and a significant upcharge (the island-inclusive package is $456 per person per night based on double occupancy, while the room-only rate starts at $302 a night), the programme now accounts for 30% of the hotel's all-inclusive leisure bookings. A similar model drew Manila-based lawyer Kathrina Sadsad-Tamesis to Nay Palad Hideaway on Siargao, a recently trendy island in south-eastern Philippines, in 2024. With rates starting at $900 per person per night, a stay at the luxury resort includes made-to-order meals, massages and private off-property excursions like surfing classes, paddleboarding along nearby mangroves or visiting the picturesque Magpupungko rock pools.  ""I like the fact that you don't need to check prices once you're there,"" Sadsad-Tamesis says, adding that she would love to see more resorts offering similar packages that build outings into their rate. To her, it encourages a more active trip. ""You don't need to think about what you are going to eat, you don't have to plan your activities, because they planned it all for you. ""Sometimes planning is the hardest part,"" she adds, ""so if the resort is already including activities, it is easier to participate."" This blend of ease and engagement appeals to many travellers. A'Rielle Thomas, a family and honeymoons specialist at Fora Travel, estimates that 50% of her all-inclusive clients are now looking for experiences beyond the resort gates. ""They don't want just a flop-and-stop vacation. They want to interact with locals and with the destination,"" she says. Thomas believes that it's an opportunity for resorts to reimagine the guest experience – and tap into a new demographic of travellers who want the best of both worlds: a great beach resort and an opportunity for adventure.  ""This is a blind spot for many resorts, because for a long time, getting guests offsite hasn't been their focus,"" she explains. ""If I'm staying at a resort but they offer a transfer and a guide to see Chichén Itzá, that's a totally different value proposition and will be more enticing to someone who might not want to sit at a beach the whole time."" But the excursions don't have to be as involved as a visit to a historical site or a day of island hopping. For some, a change of scenery for a meal could be enough, which is why Sandals launched their Island Inclusive dining programme in 2022 at Sandals Royal Curaçao. The initiative offers guests in select room categories dinner at a local restaurant, complete with transfers and a $250 dining credit. According to Jessica Shannon, chief experience officer at Sandals, this has been a wildly popular perk with a vast majority of qualifying guests taking advantage. The company now plans to bring the activation to the entire Sandals portfolio of 17 resorts.  Off-site meals are just one part of the Local Discovery initiative at Ikos Resorts, which operates seven hotels in Mediterranean hotspots like the island of Kos and the historic city of Marbella. Introduced in 2015, the initiative encourages guests to explore some of Europe's most beautiful regions for no extra cost. In addition to lunches or dinners at seafood taverns and family-owned eateries, visitors can also borrow a car for independent rides through the Costa del Sol or Mallorca's hilly interior. The Museum of Asian Art on Corfu, Pablo Picasso Museum in Marbella and Akrani winery on Kos are just some of the venues included in the brand's Culture Pass programme, which offers Ikos guests free access.  More like this: • The 25 best places to travel in 2025 • The seven travel trends that will shape 2025 • The biggest travel trend for 2025? Staying away longer Meanwhile, in 2023 Paradisus by Meliá unveiled their ""Destination-Inclusive concept"" for guests staying in higher rooms categories, which adds off-resort experiences to the all-in packages at many of their resort locations, from Los Cabos, Mexico, to Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic and Gran Canaria in Spain. At Paradisus Palma Real Golf & Spa Resort, a guest might be whisked away on a catamaran to practice yoga on an unspoiled beach. At Paradisus by Meliá Gran Canaria, meanwhile, staying in a superior room can include a guided hike around Roque Nublo or a visit to the Banana Museum.  According to Paula Forero, general manager of Paradisus Palma Real, hoteliers are learning that the needs of today's travellers – even those who are booking all-inclusives – have shifted as a result not just of the pandemic but also of social media. Now that travellers can easily consume content about the destinations of their upcoming vacation, they're feeling more intrepid, not wanting to miss out on the sights and sounds of the places they're scouting on platforms like Instagram and TikTok. ""Before, travellers were OK with spending seven days at a hotel, resting, enjoying, eating, not thinking,"" Forero explains. ""Now, no. Guests are more curious, because they have access to more information. They want more experiences, more adventures."" --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The decision has sparked concerns among tourism-dependent local businesses, who are urging authorities to extend the tourism period until the end of February to mitigate financial losses. Tourism businesses on the island, which typically operate from October to March, now face severe financial strain due to the shortened season. The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change has restricted tourist visits to just three months—November, December, and January—this year. Nilufa Yasmin Chowdhury, convener of the committee regulating tourism to Saint Martin's Island and upazila nirbahi officer (UNO) of Cox's Bazar Sadar, confirmed the government's decision. ""As per directives, tourists can visit Saint Martin's until January 31. After that, all tourist vessels will stop operating,"" she said, adding that no further instructions had been received regarding an extension. ""This is an unprecedented crisis for the island. If tourists are barred, thousands of people who rely on tourism will suffer,"" said MA Rahim Jihadi, president of the Hotel, Motel, and Resort Owners' Association of the Island. Hossain Islam Bahadur, general secretary of the Sea Cruise Operators Owners Association of Bangladesh, urged the government to reconsider. ""At least keep Saint Martin's open to tourists for February. This will help mitigate the financial losses faced by the island's residents and businesses,"" he said. Taiub Ullah, owner of St Martin Mermaid Resort, said, ""It is impossible for the people of Saint Martin's to survive the remaining ten months of the year with just two months of income. We urge the government to keep the island open until February."" He added that tourism would naturally decline in March due to Ramadan. Tourist travel to Saint Martin's resumed on December 1 from the BIWTA jetty at Nuniachhara in Cox's Bazar, with six vessels currently operating on the Cox's Bazar-Saint Martin's route. In previous years, tourist vessels operated from October to March, with services suspended during the monsoon due to rough seas. However, new restrictions have also imposed limits on overnight stays—banning them in November and capping them at 2,000 tourists per night in December and January. Starting February, all tourist visits will be banned. Previously, tourist ships also operated from Teknaf, but sediment accumulation in the Naf River and border tensions with Myanmar have halted vessel operations from that route. With the ban set to take effect from February, business owners and residents are anxiously awaiting a government response to their appeals for an extension. আজকে সেনাবাহিনী যদি গণতন্ত্রের কথা বলে, নির্বাচনের কথা বলে, এর থেকে স্বাগত জানানোর নাই কিছু আমাদের।","travel ban st martin s feb business seek extension another bangladeshi make forbes list re warlike situation sinus local bap leader shoot dead dhaka s bad govt employee can now punish infraction within work day tourist vessel saint martin island will cease operation january travel country coral island prohibit february october per government directive decision spark concern among tourism dependent local business urge authority extend tourism period end february mitigate financial loss tourism business island typically operate october march now face severe financial strain due shorten season ministry environment forest climate change restrict tourist visit just three month november december january year failure jasmine chowder convener committee regulate tourism saint martin island palazzi hairband officer uni cox bazaar radar confirm government decision per directive tourist can visit saint martin january tourist vessel will stop operate say add instruction receive regard extension unprecedented crisis island tourist bar thousand people rely tourism will suffer say ma chimera jihad president hotel motel resort owner association island hosanna islam brouhaha general secretary sea cruise operator owner association bangladesh urge government reconsider less keep saint martin open tourist february will help mitigate financial loss face island resident business say taint mullah owner st martin mermaid resort say impossible people saint martin survive remain ten month year just two month income urge government keep island open february add tourism naturally decline march due ramadan tourist travel saint martin resume december biretta jetty arachnophobia cox bazaar six vessel currently operate cox saintliness martin route previous year tourist vessel operate october march service suspend monsoon due rough sea however new restriction also impose limit overnight stay ban november cap tourist per night december january start february tourist visit will ban previously tourist ship also operate tenant sediment accumulation fan river border tension myanmar halt vessel operation route ban set take effect february business owner resident anxiously await government response appeal extension"
"'It's just not worth it': The US travellers afraid to travel abroad right now","https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250520-the-us-travellers-afraid-to-travel-abroad-right-now","Declining trust in airline safety, a rise in US citizens being detained when reentering the country and anti-American sentiment abroad have some rethinking their summer travels.","2025-05-20T13:00:00.000Z",NA,"'It's just not worth it': The US travellers afraid to travel abroad right now Declining trust in airline safety, a rise in US citizens being detained when reentering the country and growing anti-American sentiment abroad have some rethinking their summer travels. Travelling abroad used to barely faze Mary S. The American marketing professional estimates she would cross the border twice a year from her southern Arizona home to visit Los Algodones, Mexico nearby. She was also planning on attending a conference this summer in Canada to escape the Southwest US's sweltering heat. But after watching the sweeping new policies enacted by US President Donald Trump over the last three months and a notable rise in US citizens and permanent residents being detained when attempting to re-enter the country, she's having second thoughts.  ""There's no way I'm going anywhere near an airport or border crossing,"" she said. While Mary said that some of her trepidation is about the recent spate of air control tower staffing issues and near-misses, she's more worried about potential retaliation from her social media posts criticising the Trump administration, and is afraid of being harassed at border crossings. (She requested we not use her full name for the same reasons.) These worries might have once seemed outlandish, but last week Twitch streamer Hasan Piker – who is known for his criticism of Trump and his pro-Gaza policies – was reportedly detained for hours by federal agents at Chicago O'Hare International Airport after returning from France. Though eventually released, Piker said he was questioned about his views on the Middle East in an interrogation room and asked ""Do you like Donald Trump?"" In response, Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of the Department of Homeland Security posted a statement on social media saying that the interaction was ""a routine, lawful process that occurs daily, and can apply for any traveler"".  Other high-profile incidents involving the detention of US citizens have some people ""freaked out"" by the idea of international travel. Pair that with many Americans losing faith in air travel safety following a spate of recent airplane crashes and anti-American sentiment rising in Europe and Canada, and some Americans are putting their international travel plans on hold – if not outright cancelling their trips. While she says the majority of her clients continue to book and take trips as usual, travel advisor Tamara Lidbom of Anytime Travel Agency has seen some changes. ""Lawful permanent residents who are worried they will not be allowed to re-enter the United States based on changing immigration enforcement are just cancelling trips,"" she said. ""They have decided it is safer to vacation in the United States and avoid the potential risks associated with leaving the country and attempting to re-enter."" Boutique tour operator JayWay Travel has also seen a noticeable slowdown in demand from American travellers compared to last year, but the decline isn't only about flight safety or detention fears. ""Economic uncertainty and the declining US dollar [which hit a three-year low against the euro last month following Trump's tariff rollout] are definitely factors,"" says Charlie Neville, the company's marketing director. Still, airplane safety is top of mind for many travellers, as Newark Airport in New Jersey, in particular, has faced mounting problems. Last week, the airport experienced its third system outage in less than two weeks, leaving controllers unable to communicate with pilots for up to 30 seconds, and reports continue to flood in that the control room is severely understaffed. Though the airport has a target of 14 controllers, only three were monitoring airspace last Monday. Despite recent headlines, air travel in the US continues to be one of the safest modes of transportation. National Transportation Safety Board data shows fatal aviation accidents in 2025 to be below the three-year average for the same period. Yet, conversations about aviation safety have been widely covered in US media, adding to the perceived threat. According to news and intelligence agency Storyful, aviation incident discussions on social media have skyrocketed, up 243% on X accounts based in the US and 71% on Reddit compared to early 2024. That has also translated to more posts about flying anxiety, up 72% on X accounts based in the US and 22% on Reddit compared to early 2024. More like this: • How Trump's sweeping new policies could change travel • 'A hostile state': Why some travellers are avoiding the US • The US island that speaks Elizabethan English ""Safety in travel has become a daily conversation lately, as a travel advisor specialising in European travel and a wife to a commercial airline pilot,"" said Sarah Magnoni, owner of Harmony Travel Collective. ""Nearly all of my clients have inquired about safety. In 2024, I received virtually no questions on airline safety."" While Magnoni has advised her clients to avoid Newark airport in the near future if possible to avoid delays and cancellations, overall she feels confident about airline safety.  ""Commercial airline pilots aren't striking or refusing to fly at this time. That tells us everything we need to know about aviation safety right now,"" she said. Andrew Coggins, a clinical professor of management at Pace University in New York who specialises in the travel industry, also thinks Americans won't necessarily skip out on flights due to safety, even if they end up routing domestically versus internationally. ""The FAA [Federal Aviation Administration] woes are discounted by Americans booking flights since [US travellers don't] have much choice outside of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor if one wants to get somewhere fast,"" he said. ""Newark's woes will have a greater effect on future bookings than near-term reservations, since changing airports/flights might involve considerable additional expense.""  Coggins recently booked a flight to the UK, and was surprised that the flight was completely full. Even though he's been flying to the UK since 1969, the country's new visa requirement came as a shock (even though he said it was easy to do online). Many frequent US travellers also complained that changing visa requirements in foreign countries are causing them to reconsider international trips in an already anxious summer travel season.  For Magnoni, more of her American clients are also inquiring about how they may be perceived abroad in light of more nations issuing travel warnings to the US and greater calls to boycott travel to the US. For the countries she specialises in – Ireland and Scotland – Magnoni says Americans should have no problems at all. ""They're very welcoming to Americans and take pride in showcasing their countries, histories and cultures,"" she said. ""Their tourism boards are very welcoming and ready for American travellers.""  In fact, those looking for a bargain may do well to keep their European holiday plans this summer. ""This may be one of the best times in years to visit Europe: fewer crowds, more availability and great airfare deals – especially out of European cities,"" said Neville. ""Other than in Rome, we're expecting significantly lighter crowds across Europe this summer. While we're not seeing mass cancellations, we are noticing fewer inquiries and more indecisiveness. It feels a lot like summer 2022, when international travel was just starting to rebound."" Coggins still expects a busy summer travel season, but since it's just the start of the season, the tales of border crossing woes may just be beginning. That said, he still believes the greatest impact of changing policies and border crossing fears will impact international visitors here, rather than Americans going abroad. ""I think the tales of tourists' encounters with Homeland Security may have a greater effect on summer inbound tourism than Americans' worries over FAA safety or border crossing,"" he said. So far, that belief is backed up by the data. According to the US International Trade Administration, overnight visitors from Western Europe declined by 17% in March 2025 compared to the same time last year. Overall foreign arrivals were down 12% – the sharpest dip since the pandemic recovery began, according to JayWay. Perhaps most telling: according to a report published last week by the World Travel & Tourism Council (WTTC), the US is on track to lose $12.5bn (£9.4bn) in international travel spending this year. ""This is a wake-up call for the US government,"" the WTTC's President and CEO Julia Simpson said in the report. ""The world's biggest travel and tourism economy is heading in the wrong direction, not because of a lack of demand, but because of a failure to act. While other nations are rolling out the welcome mat, the US government is putting up the 'closed' sign."" Skift's recent reserach report, The Trump Effect: Skift Travel Health Index Market Analysis, quantified the lag further. The report found that overall travel dipped 2% in March, particularly from Canada, where flight bookings fell 22% and hotel bookings dropped 34% following a spike in bilateral tensions. France, Italy, Mexico and Brazil are also seeing declines. Americans staying home this summer may provide a buffer to the travel and tourism sector. Skift's report found that US domestic travel activity has remained nearly flat year-on-year. The report theorises that the weakening dollar may also keep Americans at home, with an uptick in particular to drive-to destinations. Many US destinations are taking note. Vail, Colorado, one of the US's most popular ski resorts and home to a Tyrolean-style village, is currently marketing itself as providing the charm of a European holiday without visitors having to fly across the pond. It's also promoting its support for public lands even among federal budget and staffing cuts. Jesse Neugarten, founder and CEO of Dollar Flight Club, suggests dupes like Santa Fe, New Mexico as a stateside stand-in for Spain; Sedona, Arizona for Morocco; and the Florida Keys instead of international beach vacations. ""These destinations offer similar vibes without the long-haul flights or price tags,"" he said. According to Alex Alioto, head of growth at vacation rental firm Whimstay, many US travellers seem keen to stay in the US this summer and explore destinations relatively close to home. ""We've been seeing a lot of inner-state bookings in the US, so people from California travelling within California, Texans traveling within Texas. Not only is domestic travel leading over international, but people aren't venturing outside of state lines.""  One such person is American traveller Emily Dreilich. Though she had her heart set on travelling to Bolivia this summer, she decided to cancel and remain stateside. ""The combination of increased reports of flight disruptions, border control unpredictability and just this general tension in the air right now is what really made me stop and rethink,"" Dreilich said. ""When that anxiety gets high enough to mess with your trip from day one, it's just not worth it, especially if your vacation is short. When you only get one trip a year, you're not being paranoid for wanting a smooth entry and exit."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

"From sea sparkles to fireflies: Chasing Australia's 'big four'","https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250508-australias-mysterious-glowing-big-four","In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny creatures lighting up the dark.","2025-05-09T10:00:00.000Z",NA,"From sea sparkles to fireflies: Chasing Australia's 'big four' In Australia's Illawarra region, a ghostbusting-style night tour reveals ghost fungi, sea sparkles and tiny creatures lighting up the dark. On a slate-black night, I stare at a horizon freckled with stars. Only this isn't the sky, illuminated by hundreds of constellations; it's the muddy bank of a river, charged by a colony of glow worms. ""This is my TV,"" says David Finlay. ""It's magical, like something out of Avatar."" By day, Finlay works as a transport manager, but by night, he scours Australia's bushland and beaches chasing living light. ""If you're tucked up at home, you miss these things. Everybody cocoons themselves at night, whereas I think, what fun can I have?"" he says.  Bioluminescent creatures lurk in many corners of the world, but Australia's Illawarra region on New South Wales' south coast is a magnet for glowing phenomena. With low light pollution, ample rainfall and high humidity, it's an ideal microclimate for these creatures to thrive and trap prey. Many are clustered along the Illawarra Escarpment, a sweep of sandstone cliffs, fringed with forests that roll into the Pacific Ocean. ""Our escarpment habitat is special. It's a well-preserved subtropical rainforest environment, which helps protect fragile bioluminescent life forms,"" says Finlay. From his home in Kiama, Finlay can spot the ""big four"" within an hour's drive. There's sea sparkle, plankton that paints the ocean an electric blue; ghost fungi, mushrooms that radiate an eerie green; and glow worms and fireflies, which pierce the night-sky like tiny lanterns. These natural phenomena are notoriously unpredictable and fickle to find, dictated by seasons, weather and light patterns. They are also extremely fragile, as mounting evidence shows bioluminescent creatures are waning with climate-change and human disturbance. But for a growing number of glow seekers, who, like Finlay, visit with care, the challenge is part of the adventure. When I meet Finlay at a clearing near Cascade Falls in Macquarie Pass National Park, it's only an hour past sunset, yet we're cloaked in darkness. It's Friday night, and while most people are under artificial lights, toasting to the end of the week, we're here to find natural shimmers in the night. We trek through a path that cuts through the towering eucalypt trees, our head torches glowing red to cause minimal disturbance to wildlife. The full Moon pilots from above and the flow of the river whooshes us forward, guiding our footsteps towards the waterfall. ""If something flies straight past your face, it's probably just a micro bat,"" warns Finlay. ""They're very gentle, they're just looking for insects to eat."" Cascade Falls has an ideal microclimate for glow worms and fireflies, he explains. Glow worms aren't worms – in Australia and New Zealand, they are the larvae of fungus gnat. Elsewhere in the world, the glow often comes from beetles. They hide in wet, dark places, such as dank caves, abandoned tunnels or thick rainforest. Glow worms are endemic to Australia and New Zealand, and while many travellers visit iconic spots like Tamborine Mountain in Queensland, there are lesser-known colonies that can be discovered if you know where to look. As my eyes adjust, I begin to notice more – the gnarled roots of a tree and a feathery mushroom cap. Finlay's vision is far better trained; he can easily spot silver spiders eyes blinking at us like cat's eyes on a motorway. He sweeps a UV torch across the floor, illuminating the undergrowth. A caterpillar glows fluorescent white, some lichen neon green, a leaf an aggressive shade of electric blue. ""Ah, that's just possum wee,"" he clarifies.  Finlay runs ad hoc glow tours (when available, he posts them on his Facebook page) in the Illawarra, showing locals and visitors the spectacle that most of us overlook at night. Last year, a few hundred places on his guided walks sold in a flash – as 25,000 people vied to secure a spot. ""For a lot of people, it's like finding gold, and nobody will tell you where they find the gold,"" says Finlay. But it's a delicate balance between educating visitors and conserving these habitats. ""This national park is already impacted by people. I don't tell people about the really natural spots, as too many people would destroy those environments,"" he says.  More like this: • The Indian Ocean's laid-back 'paradise on Earth' • India's mysterious glowing forests • How a fictitious 'sea' became a top Maldivian tourist attraction Both fireflies and glow worms are incredibly sensitive, susceptible to habitat destruction from people, urbanisation and bush fires. The ""Black Summer"" bushfires of 2019-20 wiped out a ""horrific"" number of bioluminescent creatures, he says, with colonies impacted in national parks across Australia. ""I give people a list of dos and don'ts when they're out in the environment, and I tell them to teach other people this,"" says Finlay.  A golden rule, like almost everything in the natural world, is to look but not touch. ""So much as holding a glow worm in the palm of your hand will kill them,"" says Finlay. Bright flashing lights or even breathing too close can trigger them to shut down and disrupt their feeding patterns. We keep our voices low and hushed, and we tread carefully, making sure to move through the bush slowly. For safety, Finlay suggests bringing a friend on a night adventure. He beams a laser pointer through the sky, tracing the kite-like constellation of the Southern Cross, in case I ever get lost and need to navigate my way south. How to see glow worms responsibly: We scramble down the embankment towards the mouth of the waterfall, following the tiny orbs of light. Tucked in the overhang of the river are dozens of glow worms, like a fairy grotto or twinkling Christmas light display. Up close, tendrils of silky web drip down, hanging like strings of pearls. ""Glow worms hide from sunlight, they'll crawl into nooks and crannies during the day, and when they come out at night, they have to rebuild their webs,"" says Finlay. Despite their beauty, these webs are death traps – snaring insects that are lured by glow-worm light. Under the lens of the camera, the riverbank looks even more spectacular, with crystal droplets clustered around an iridescent light. It's clear why Bioluminescence Australia – a Facebook group with more than 64,000 members – has become so popular. The page was created to share photos of bioluminescent phytoplankton blooms, but it's also a message board for tracking down glowing phenomena. Glow hunters follow a rough calendar – glow worms can generally be found year-round, whereas fireflies glimmer for a short window in Australia's late spring/summer (November to February). Elusive ghost mushrooms tend to fruit in autumn (March to May) when the temperature cools. One of the most sought-after experiences is paddling through bioluminescence, or bio. ""Everybody wants to see it, and one of the reasons is that it's so Instagrammable. You can swish your feet through it and make sparkles,"" says Finlay. One of the best spots to see a ""blue tide"" in Australia is in Jervis Bay, further along the NSW south coast, or around Hobart in Tasmania. Christine Dean Smith is a member of the group who has photographed sea sparkles for more than a decade. ""I hunt for bio because I have skin cancer and I'm banned from daylight,"" she says. ""Being a photographer, you tend to adjust yourself to finding nighttime nature to capture instead and then I show it to my followers."" When we've spotted enough nature glowing, we retreat back through the bush to the clearing. Something flashes in my vision under Finlay's fluorescent torch – vivid, electric even; everything I've been told to keep my eyes peeled for. Maybe, I'm getting the hang of hunting for sparkles in the dark. ""Nope, just more possum wee,"" Finlay says. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.   For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.  Japanese scientists take pregnant sharks, killed in fishing nets, and rescue their unborn young.

"Inside the fortress that inspired Hamlet","https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250416-inside-the-fortress-that-inspired-hamlet","As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy.","2025-04-25T13:00:00.000Z",NA,"Inside the fortress that inspired Hamlet As Radiohead and the RSC launch an innovative reinterpretation of Hamlet, a visit to the play's setting in Denmark brings a new dimension to the tragedy. There's a cold wind blowing from the Øresund Sound as I stand on a platform in front of Kronborg Castle in Helsingør, Denmark, looking out to Sweden. At one end of the platform, a pillar-box red guard post stands beside a row of impressive cannons facing the strait. I'm not here for the view though: I'm looking for ghosts.  This windy spot is the exact location for the opening scene of Hamlet, Shakespeare's best-known tragedy. Here, two guards, Francisco and Bernardo, switch posts in the middle of the night and speak of the ghost of Hamlet's father. The castle behind me, a grand Renaissance pile built in 1574 complete with fairytale turrets, a moat and a grand banqueting hall, is where the rest of the lurid drama unfolds. This year, the Royal Shakespeare Company is presenting no fewer than three variations on the story: a radical adaptation using Radiohead's album Hail to the Thief as its score (from 27 April); Fat Ham, a comic tragedy that transplants Hamlet's story into the Deep South (from 15 August); and a traditional take in Rupert Goold's production starring Luke Thallon (from 8 February). For context, the last time the RSC staged Hamlet was back in 2016.  ""There's something in the air right now saying that the play has resonance,"" says Tamara Harvey, co-artistic director at the RSC, noting that all three producers had approached the RSC to stage their productions in the same year.  As a play that deals with themes of generational differences and changing world orders, not to mention the sense that ""there's something rotten in the state of Denmark"" – the idea that society's foundations no longer feel secure – it's hard to miss its appeal. Today, nothing looks rotten in Helsingør – the modern-day name for Shakespeare's town of Elsinore. The sky is blue and the sun is glinting off a gold flag flying at the top of one of the turrets. I'm on a tour with castle host Louise Older Steffensen to uncover Kronborg's Hamlet connections. Our feet echo as we walk around the stone corridors and into the grand ballroom with its chequerboard floor and soaring wooden ceiling, as she tells me there is no evidence that Shakespeare ever visited Kronborg – but he certainly knew it well. ""We have contracts that tell us that Shakespeare's colleagues visited the castle,"" she says. ""We know that the actors Thomas Pope, George Bryan and William Kempe were here for a season, performing plays for the Danish king. When they returned to England, they set up the Lord Chamberlain's Men, Shakespeare's company."" They may have brought back tales of what happened within its walls. A distinctive celebration is mentioned in the play: a toast followed by the bang of a kettle drum, a trumpet, and a cannon – and it comes from a tradition followed in the castle at that time. In a dimly lit room next to the ballroom, the tapestries from that era are on display, their gilded threads depicting mythologised kings. Long curtains hang around the queen's bedchamber and around the castle, softening the sandstone walls, dampening sound and making it a fraction warmer – as well as providing opportunities for dramatic intrigue.  Visiting the castle feels like being immersed in the play, walking down the large gallery where the silk dresses of the ladies-in-waiting would have rustled into its beautifully preserved church. It's as if the play itself has come to life, and the castle plays up to that theatricality. In the summer, special tours invite guests to participate in Hamlet-inspired murder mystery-style tours, and in the autumn, Hallowe'en tours take place in the creepy basements. Nobody, to date, has seen the ghost of Hamlet's father – but there have been other ghostly sightings, according to Steffensen and assorted castle guides. More clues about the importance of this castle to Shakespeare emerge as Steffensen gives me a history lesson. James I married Denmark's teenage princess, Anne, in 1589. When Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 and King James ascended to the throne, England had a Danish queen. ""The first quarto – written very early in 1603 – is set in Denmark,"" said Steffensen, ""but there are no specific locations in it. After Anne becomes Queen of England, we get references to the castle itself."" King James became the patron of Shakespeare's company and their name changed from ""The Lord Chamberlain's Men"" to ""The King's Men"" in 1603. Queen Anne's castle in Denmark became an important location for the royal family and thus gained a starring role in the play. We climb to the top of the cannon tower, a large flat space in a corner of the castle. Views reach across the moat to the yellow barracks buildings around it and to the town beyond. It's in one of these barracks buildings, the former infirmary that is now the headquarters of the town's Shakespeare Festival, where I find out more about the legacy of Hamlet in Helsingør. Lars Romann Engel, CEO and artistic director of HamletScenen, the castle's professional theatre body, welcomes me into a hallway-cum-gallery of Hamlet actors through the decades. In a who's who of Hamlets, black and white headshots of Jude Law, Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Derek Jacobi, David Tennant, Richard Burton and Christopher Plummer cover the walls and stairwell. Hamlet played a part in reinventing this town into a cultural hub after its shipbuilding industry collapsed in the 1980s, as the municipality devised a way to create a producing theatre at the Unesco-listed castle. Engel set up the town's Shakespeare festival, which takes place at the castle every August, showing adaptations of Hamlet in many guises; previous shows have included Spaghetti Western versions, dark German variants by experimental theatre Schaubüne and a sell-out staging starring Jude Law. As well as Hamlet, the festival typically also produces a lighter Shakespeare work, often with music and other events. Both plays are performed in the open air with the castle as a backdrop; tickets book out a long way in advance and the audience typically shows up with a picnic. More like this: • Nordhavn: The Danish 'city' that's been designed for an easy life • Denmark's surf town where old-school fishermen and surfers live in harmony • Copenhagen's 'CopenPay' scheme rewards tourists – but does it actually work? A trained theatre director himself, Engel directed a very successful adaptation of Hamlet in 2008, set in the castle's courtyard with tumbledown walls and crumbling masonry – starring a young Claes Bang as Rosenkrantz – and, after a mutual decision with the local municipality, set up the festival following its success. He has been running and directing the event for the past 17 years.  ""When you see Hamlet here, you know that you enter the myth,"" said Engel. ""Now you are at the epicentre of it all. It's a special thing: it was actually here that it was written for."" Engel takes me on a tour of some of the other barracks buildings, ending in the Lapidarium, the sculpture storage room of the castle, where a full-size sculpture of Shakespeare sits beside a sleeping Viking warrior, Holger Danske. Danske is another significant figure for the castle: according to legend, when Denmark needs him, he'll wake up and come to its aid. A reproduction of this original model lurks in the gloom of the castle cellars.  Engel is in the throes of arranging this year's festival, which will take place 6-24 August and feature both Twelfth Night and Hamlet, performed by The Lord Chamberlain's Men, who take a classical Elizabethan approach to the works and perform with an all-male cast.  ""This year we've taken a more classical approach,"" said Engel, ""because right now the world is edgy. When we are a little afraid, we don't like it to be upside down and we want it to be more as we know it."" In testament to the endless ways the play can be reinvented, however, Engel also plans to put on Eddie Izzard's one-person Hamlet at the stage this year. It's often said that every minute of every day, Hamlet is being performed somewhere in the world. Shakespeare's most popular play in his lifetime has an afterlife, 425 years later, that surpasses all expectations. ""It's one of the greatest pieces of writing in the English language, dealing with the very nature of human existence,"" says Harvey. ""A play wrangling with this fundamental issue with such complexity is always going to mean different things to different people."" Visiting Kronborg Castle, experiencing the ""set"" of the play in real life, certainly brings it to life. As I exit the castle, crossing the bridge over the moat, past the guardhouse to the grass fortifications around the castle, the sounds of marching feet echo through the sound system. I'm back in the world of the play, at the end of Hamlet, joining the march where the prince's body is taken away. --  If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.  For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking.","2025-03-19T12:00:00.000Z",NA,"A local expert's guide to seeing the most beautiful tulips in the Netherlands Nienke Panis-Ringersma has made a career out of following the region's famous blooms. Here are her favourite ways to experience the season, from road trips to bulb picking. Few images are as indelible as the sight of candy-coloured tulips bursting through the dark winter ground. But in the Netherlands – the world's largest exporter of the magical bloom – venerating tulips is a way of life. In the weeks leading from icy winter to spring, rows of flowers stud the country's landscape in technicolour streaks, most famously in the Bollenstreek ""Bulb Region"", stretching between the towns of Haarlem and Leiden, arching towards the North Sea. And with tulips come tourists; eager to experience the blooms for themselves. The SpeciaList Nienke Panis-Ringersma is the owner of the photography and Dutch culture blog Tulips in Holland, which now also shares its tulip photos and weekly flower updates via X, Instagram and most recently TikTok. She is a licensed national tour guide, and her husband says she eats, sleeps and dreams tulips. We spoke to Nienke Panis-Ringersma, the lens behind the popular Dutch-based tulip photography blog, Tulips in Holland, to find the best tulip bloom experiences in the Netherlands. ""People in the Netherlands are very down to earth,"" says Panis-Ringersma, whose images and tulip facts receive thousands of likes per month on Facebook. ""They are quite used to the flower fields. You know when it's tourist season, because the roads are clogged with people on a bike who are not used to riding bikes."" Nonetheless, Panis-Ringersma adores her nation's iconic bulb flower – enough to have made it her career. ""I think it's the excitement,"" she says. ""It starts around December when we can buy tulips in the florist shops. And around the third weekend of January, we celebrate National Tulip Day. Around 300,000 tulips are placed on the museum square in Amsterdam with a beautiful backdrop of the Rijksmuseum or the Van Gogh Museum. It's the start of many tulip festivals leading up to the start of spring. It's a magical place and I love the flower, the fragrance. Every tulip is unique. There is a great story to tell.""  Here are Nienke Panis-Ringersma's favourite ways to experience tulip season in the Netherlands. 1. Best overall: Keukenhof ""So, you ask for absolutely number one place? Visit Keukenhof,"" says Panis-Ringersma. Established in 1949, Keukenhof Gardens is undoubtedly the most popular tulip experience in the Netherlands; its lushly landscaped ""inspirational"" tulip gardens and windmills drawing over a million visitors each year during its eight-week season. ""Around 7 million bulbs are planted by hands, not by machine, every year,"" says Panis-Ringersma, whose budding love for tulips was ignited by childhood visits to Keukenhof, where her grandfather volunteered as a ticket taker. ""It's the most beautiful spring garden in the world.""   Responsible Flower Viewing Tourists, take note; in the Netherlands, it's illegal to park near or walk through tulip fields. ""Flower fields are commercial fields,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""You can damage crops by entering with your normal shoes, when you bring in bacteria, especially the hyacinths are very sensitive to that. And you don't want to have people over in the fields taking photos, picking flowers over there. Some tourists think that the fields are for there for them."" Visitors enjoy a wide variety of experiences at Keukenhof including picnics, flower exhibitions and didactic ""whisper boat"" cruises through the gardens, where contemporary art sculptures dot the grounds. But plan ahead; Keukenhof is open for just two months, usually from the first day of Spring to the first week of May, depending on the weather (in 2025, 20 March to 11 May). ""The best time to go is the $1m question,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""It's different every year… right now we have an extremely warm winter. I think the best time to visit for this year is around the middle of April.""

Best cultural experience: Catching the Bloemencorso Flower Parade To truly get swept up in the excitement of tulip season, be sure to catch the Bloemencorso Flower Parade.  ""A flower parade is a very festive flower festival,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""It's about 20 different floats, marching bands, cars very lavishly decorated with all kinds of flowers, people enjoying themselves, street entertainment… every town is a very festive atmosphere."" Insider Bloemencorso Flower Parade tip Panis-Ringersma encourages visitors to also catch the events surrounding parade day. ""Not many people know that there's the Night Parade on Friday evening,"" she says. ""It's in Noordwijkerhout, a very small town. People gather there to look at the parade floats, have a drink and have something to eat outside on the terrace."" During the Night Parade, the floats are illuminated, creating a magical atmosphere. And on float Construction Days (Wednesday to Friday), spectators can watch volunteers decorate the floats with thousands of flowers. On Sunday afternoon, after the parade, the floats are displayed for one last time in the city of Haarlem. The Bloemencorso parade takes place each year on the third Saturday of April, marching along the road from Noordwijk to Haarlem, through the Bollenstreek and past Keukenhof. ""It's a full day,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""People line up at least three four lines thick to see. Some people get their seats ready at least three hours before the parade to make sure… it's like a Disney parade. People are sitting down on the streets waiting for the parade to pass by."" Panis-Ringersma's tip: watch from Noordwijk. ""Lots of people try to see the parade around Keukenhof because it passes the gardens,"" she says. ""But that's an extremely busy spot. Go to Noordwijk early in the morning. It's a beautiful seaside town."" While waiting for the parade, feast on Dutch Stroopwafel cookies, or have lunch at Panis-Ringersma's casual Dutch dining pick, Hudson Restaurant. ""It's a very festive day,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""Every town is having markets … it's an absolute must-see for people traveling to the Netherlands."" Website: https://bloemencorso-bollenstreek.nl/en/ Phone: +31 (0)252 428 237 Instagram: @bloemencorsobollenstreek 3. Best interactive experience: Visiting a tulip farm For those who aren't satisfied merely admiring the blooms from afar, Panis-Ringersma suggests visiting a tulip farm. ""Because everybody really wants to go into the fields, which is not allowed,"" she says. ""So, please go to a tulip farm where it is allowed!"" Panis-Ringersma's three farm recommendations are all found in the heart of the Bollenstreek. ""All three are founded by bulb growers,"" she says. ""So, they know absolutely what they are doing. They're all a very hands-on experience."" The family-run Tulip Experience in Noordwijkerhout is Panis-Ringersma's first pick; home to nearly 1 million tulips. ""You can go to the field where you can see at least 700 different types of tulips,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""You can visit the tulip market with all kinds of products made of tulips or with tulips on it. You can pick your own tulips. It's a very fun experience."" What sort of tulip products? ""Beer with tulips, tulip vodka, tulip Aperol Spritz, soap smelling of tulips, vases, napkins with tulips, wallets with tulips,"" she says. ""If you can name it, everything with tulips."" Alternatively, visit Tulip Barn in Hillegom just 30 minutes outside of Amsterdam, where visitors can immerse themselves in the 750,000 tulips sprawling across the farm's gardens and production field. ""They are more focused on making Instagrammable photos,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""So, for a bit younger target audience."" Heading further south, Panis-Ringersma also likes De Tulperij in Voorhout. ""You can go together with the bulb grower,"" she says. ""You're walking into the fields. He will dig up some tulip bulbs and will show you how they are growing and what they are doing each year to make them grow. It's a very interesting environment.""

Best for kids: Tulip picking For visitors with antsy kids (and a car), Panis-Ringersma loves tulip picking in the Bollenstreek. ""Not in the regular fields where you can say as you're walking, 'Oh, I like this one!'"" she says. ""No, just go to a to a picking farm and pick your own tulips."" Tulip Road Trip Map When roaming the Bollenstreek, it's helpful to have a plan – like Panis-Ringersma's helpful tulip road trip map; perfect for navigating the area by car or by bike. ""The green map square is Keukenhof,"" she explains. ""All the yellow stars are flower fields. The pink line is a long route among various flower fields; the blue is a route towards the beach. And when you drive by bike or by car, you will absolutely find tulip fields in bloom regardless the time of season during springtime."" There are several picking farms in the Bollenstreek area, but Panis-Ringersma recommends heading to Annemieke's Pluktuin, a tulip nursery in Hillegom run by husband-and-wife team, Annemieke and Pieter. ""Pluktuin is literally 'picking garden',"" explains Panis-Ringersma. ""Tulip picking is an absolutely brilliant experience, especially when you go with children to walk into the field and get the tulip with the bulb and you can take the bulb and the tulip with you back home or to the hotel.""

Best for tulip aficionados: Hortus Bulborum For Panis-Ringersma, whose passion for tulip photography led her to become an expert in tulip horticulture, the Hortus Bulborum historical bulb garden in Limmen is a sacred institute of learning. Did You Know? ""An interesting fact about tulips,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""It's not native to the Netherlands but people think it is."" Tulips are, in fact, native to the Himalayas, where they flourished as a small red mountain flower before being brought to Turkey in the 1400s. ""People from Turkey went to the Himalayas and took this magical flower,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""They thought, 'Oh, it's very interesting. Let's see if we can make it taller or different colours.' At the end of the 16th Century, it came to the Netherlands. People would have thought, 'Okay, it's a very ugly bulb, but there comes a beautiful flower out of it.'"" ""It's like a living museum,"" she says. ""Tulips entered the Netherlands around the 16th Century. And people loved them from the very beginning. And right now, there is one place in the Netherlands that keep the bulbs alive from the 16th Century and later on. So, this is a place where you can visit and find the oldest bulbs of the Netherlands still blooming."" The Hortus Bulborum houses more than 4,500 varieties of historical spring bulbous plants, from tulips to daffodils to hyacinths, which are rarely cultivated in modern day. The garden's star bulbs include a specimen of Fritillaria Persica, dating to 1557, and the ancient 16th-Century tulip Duc van Tol Red and Yellow. ""So, you can visit and it's a very small garden,"" says Panis-Ringersma. ""They have great apple pie! So absolutely visit and drink some coffee with apple pie over there and have a look at all the different kinds of flowers.""

"Where to get New York City's best Chinese food","https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20250505-where-to-get-new-york-citys-best-chinese-food","Proud New Yorker chef Calvin Eng is known for his daring reinterpretations of Chinese cuisine. Here's where he goes when he wants homestyle Chinese food, from dim sum to egg tarts.","2025-05-07T13:00:00.000Z",NA,"Where to get New York City's best Chinese food Proud New Yorker chef Calvin Eng is known for his daring reinterpretations of Chinese cuisine. Here's where he goes when he wants homestyle Chinese food, from dim sum to egg tarts. Though its original Chinatown in Lower Manhattan – dating to the 1870s – is the most well-known, New York City is actually home to nine official Chinatowns spread across its five boroughs; each reflecting the rich regional diversity of Chinese cuisine. The city's first Chinatown took root when Chinese immigrants, many from southern China, arrived either directly or relocated from the US's West Coast, fleeing anti-Chinese sentiment. Early businesses were mostly rice shops and teahouses, but by the early 1900s, full-service restaurants emerged, drawing curious diners from all over New York. By the mid-20th Century, Chinese food, in all its glorious forms, had become as associated with New York City as the humble bagel or the New York slice. The SpeciaList Brooklyn-born Calvin Eng is the chef and owner of Bonnie's, which has been praised in the New York Times, The New Yorker, Grub Street, Eater and Bon Appétit. Eng is a James Beard Emerging Chef finalist, a Food & Wine Best New Chef, a Forbes 30 under 30 recipient, a StarChefs Rising Star and a two-time James Beard Best Chef: New York State Semifinalist. His cookbook, Salt Sugar MSG, was published on 18 March 2025. Among the new generation carrying this legacy forward is chef Calvin Eng, the owner of Bonnie's; a Cantonese American restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that has been lauded for its inventive interpretations of Cantonese cuisine. Eng grew up in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, learning to cook the food of Guangdong (formerly known as Canton) from his mother, the eponymous Bonnie. Weekends were spent visiting his grandparents on Bayard Street in New York City's Lower Manhattan Chinatown, where he developed a deep connection to the neighbourhood and its food. ""There's just so much good food in such a small area,"" Eng says. ""You learn what's worth lining up for and what's best eaten on a subway platform."" These days, Eng gets his Cantonese fix at a variety of New York's Chinatowns, from Sunset Park to Bensonhurst, each offering its own take on Chinese flavours – from the seafood-heavy dishes of Guangdong to the bold, spicy flavours of Sichuan and Hunan. Despite the breadth of regional styles found across the city, Eng's focus remains rooted in the cuisine of southern China. Unlike other styles, Cantonese food is known for its lightness and simplicity, emphasising fresh ingredients, particularly seafood – a reflection of the region's coastal geography. Heavy spices are rare, and rice – not wheat – is the dominant starch. ""Cantonese food is very low on acid and heat,"" Eng explains. ""We use minimal ingredients that allow the main ingredients to shine."" Here are Eng's favourite places to get Chinese food in New York City. Insiders know that in Chinatowns across the world, some of the most unassuming places have the best food. Yi Ji Shi Mo – a tiny, below-street-level hole-in-the-wall on Lower Manhattan's Elizabeth Street – is no exception. Here, the specialty is made-to-order cheung fun; Cantonese-style steamed rice rolls filled with shrimp, beef, pork and other savoury ingredients. Cheung fun can be found all over New York City's Chinatowns, but Eng says what makes the offerings at Yi Ji Shi Mo stand out is their rice wrapper: it's perfectly thin with a satisfying chew and bounce. ""They mill the rice into flour fresh every morning to make the batter,"" he explains. ""Then they steam it, fill it, roll it up, pop it in a takeout box, give you a packet of their seasoned soy sauce, and you're on your way."" Eng eats cheung fun for breakfast, lunch or just a snack whenever he's in the area. The wait can be a bit long since everything is made fresh, but he says it's worth it – or you can try calling ahead. ""My go-to is always the large – which isn't even that large – with beef, scallion and cilantro,"" he says. ""And I just douse it in their soy sauce."" Address: 88 Elizabeth Street, New York, NY 10013 Phone: +1 646-233-6311 A little slice of Xinjian, an autonomous region in north-western China, can be found at the iconic Grand Street Skewer Cart on Lower Manhattan's Grand Street. The vendors are a husband-and-wife duo who prepare Xinjian-style meat skewers (yang rou chuan) straight out of a cooler; you can smell the sizzling aroma of roasted lamb and spicy cumin from over a block away, says Eng. ""I don't know what their schedule is, but when they're there, it's a treat, like a special surprise,"" he says. ""If it's raining, snowing or even just a little cold, they're probably not going to be there. But when the weather's nice, you have to take the chance and go."" The cart is set up just outside a busy train station, and like many commuters, Eng buys a bunch of the inexpensive skewers to eat on the subway ride home to Brooklyn. The selection is impressive: lamb, beef, chicken, fish balls, mushrooms, onions, leeks – even aubergine. ""Whether you get it spicy or not is up to you,"" Eng says, ""but the spicy skewers are very, very tasty."" ""The cart is really special and unique – you don't find anything like it in Chinatown,"" he adds. ""Restaurants aren't doing this kind of thing because it's live fire and not easy to pull off. Getting to experience that on the street is very cool."" Address: Corner of Grand St and Chrystie Street, New York, NY 10002 The Chinese banquet experience is a joyful multi-course feast typically shared at big, round tables to celebrate birthdays, weddings or even just a fun night out with friends. Eng's go-to for a classic banquet is Hop Lee on Mott Street; a beloved Chinatown institution since 1973, with all the essentials: oversized tables, lazy Susans and a vast menu. ""They have the old-school stuff you can't get all in one place anymore,"" Eng says. Highlights include razor clams in black bean sauce, honey walnut shrimp and a wide variety of chicken dishes: half, whole, poached, fried. But one dish in particular stands out to Eng: the eternally popular Cantonese lobster with pork. ""It starts with the Chinese trinity of ginger, garlic and scallions,"" Eng explains. The lobster is broken down Chinese-style, which means it's chopped into 14 easy-to-eat pieces, so there's no need for cracking shells. ""The flavours of the trinity really come through in the wok,"" he says, ""and they stir-fry it with ground pork, which adds this whole extra layer of depth that most lobster dishes just don't have. It's delicious.""

For Eng, King's Kitchen stands out for serving the best of these iconic barbecued meats. With multiple locations across Manhattan and Brooklyn, the purveyor offers a vast menu, including dim sum, but it's the roasted meats that keep Eng coming back. Insider tip: When ordering char siu, Eng says you can request your preferred cuts. ""You can order lean, you can order fat or you can order half and half,"" says Eng, who orders his half fatty, half lean. ""The guy at the counter will know which cuts to pull and chop for your order. If you don't specify, they just give you whatever."" But, he adds, ""I think it's a very different eating experience to get what you prefer. I love the half-and-half bites."" ""The char siu (roast pork) is perfectly balanced – sweet and salty, charred and glistening because it's always fresh,"" he says. The marinade, a blend that includes bean paste and Chinese five-spice, is rubbed inside the cavity of the pig, giving the meat deep, rich flavour all the way through. ""King's Kitchen does steady business, so they're popping out fresh things all the time,"" Eng adds. ""This way you know the meat is not just sitting there all day."" Website: kingskitchenusa.com/ Address: 92 East Broadway, New York, NY 10002 Phone: +1 212-966-7288 Instagram: @jinhuanggroup/ When he's in the mood for seafood, Eng heads to Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighbourhood to hit BK Seafood Market – a large restaurant with rows of bubbling tanks filled with live fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Diners can pick exactly what they want and have it cooked to order, just minutes from tank to table. ""It's a rare opportunity to eat something that was literally swimming two minutes before it was cooked,"" says Eng. One of his favourite orders is king crab prepared three ways, a ""massive feast of king crab"", he says. He also chooses a fresh whole fish and asks for it steamed with soy sauce, ginger and spring onions. ""When the seafood is this fresh, you don't want to ruin it,"" he says. ""Steaming keeps it clean and simple and that's how you taste how good it really is."" Website: www.bkseafoodmarketnyc.com/ Address: 842 64th St, Brooklyn, NY 11220 Phone: +1 718-836-6888 Instagram: @bkseafoodmarket1/ ""If I want the full dim sum experience, I go for a big location – a place with, like, 1,000 seats,"" says Eng. For that, he heads to Park Asia; a sprawling two-storey space with high ceilings and a bright, bustling vibe. ""It's where I had my son's 100-day party [a celebration marking a child's first 100 days in Chinese culture] with 100 people,"" he says. For Eng, the ideal dim sum restaurant offers the most variety. ""When I get dim sum from a cart, I want a lot of different things on the table,"" he says. And the key to a good spot? ""It should be packed. That means the food's fresh, and nothing's been sitting on the cart for more than half an hour."" The selection is huge, from pork siu mai and shrimp dumplings to specials that rotate with the seasons. In the evenings, Park Asia shifts into banquet-style dining, but the dim sum crowd is always out in full force – even on a Monday morning. Website: park-asia.restaurants-world.com/ Address: 6521 8th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11220 Phone: +1 718-833-1688 Instagram: @parkasiarestaurant/ For the best egg tarts in the city, Eng makes a beeline to Xin Fa Bakery. But he doesn't just buy one. ""You get a dozen,"" he says. ""They're always hot and always fresh."" These are the classic Hong Kong-style dan tat – small, flaky tarts filled with silky egg custard. For Eng, the perfect one has a wobble. ""When you bite into it, it should be jiggly and almost fall out of the crust,"" he explains. ""You don't want it to be fully set. And you definitely don't want to see your teeth marks in it.""

Most of the turtles were females that came ashore to lay eggs but faced accidental deaths, said Mohammad Shimul Bhuiyan, a scientific officer at Bangladesh Oceanographic Research Institute (BORI). ""We are investigating the specific causes of deaths,"" Bhuiyan said, adding that 99 Olive Ridley turtle carcasses were recovered from the same area during the last breeding season. ""November to March is the breeding season for sea turtles. During this time, females come ashore to lay eggs. However, many turtles die during this period due to getting entangled in fishing nets, collisions with vessels, or even attacks by stray dogs,"" he added. HM Ershad, president of the Cox's Bazar chapter of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA), said, ""Turtles used to come and lay eggs in areas like Saint Martin's, Sonadia, Teknaf, Sonarpara, Pechar Dwip, and Himchhari. Uncontrolled tourism has disrupted their habitat. Additionally, around 20,000 fishing trawlers operate in the waters near Sandwip, Sonadia, Kutubdia, and other coastal areas, using nets that often trap turtles. Fishermen sometimes kill these turtles to avoid complications, and their bodies later wash ashore.""""We will submit a memorandum to the deputy commissioner demanding steps to protect turtles,"" he said. আজকে সেনাবাহিনী যদি গণতন্ত্রের কথা বলে, নির্বাচনের কথা বলে, এর থেকে স্বাগত জানানোর নাই কিছু আমাদের।","turtle find dead cox s bazaar beach another bangladeshi make forbes list re warlike situation sinus local bap leader shoot dead dhaka s bad govt employee can now punish infraction within work day less carcass olive riddle sea turtle recover last three day cox bazaar beach tenant mariachi turtle female come ashore lie egg face accidental death say mohammad mulish subhuman scientific officer bangladesh oceanographic research institute bear investigate specific cause death subhuman say add olive riddle turtle carcass recover area last breed season november march breed season sea turtle time female come ashore lie egg however many turtle die period due get entangle fish net collision vessel even attack stray dog add hm er shad president cox bazaar chapter bangladesh proscribe abandon baps say turtle use come lie egg area like saint martin diapason tenant sonar para peccary dip mariachi uncontrolled tourism disrupt habitat additionally around fish trawler operate water near sandwich diapason subdivide coastal area use net often trap turtle fisherman sometimes kill turtle avoid complication body late wash ashore will submit memorandum deputy commissioner demand step protect turtle say"
